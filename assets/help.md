# QBasic Project Help Document

Welcome to the QBasic project, a minimal BASIC language interpreter. This project allows you to learn about expression trees and class inheritance, and gain a deeper understanding of how programming languages work. You can adapt existing programs to solve different but related tasks, experiencing the process of modifying existing systems.

**Features Overview:**
- Supports basic BASIC statements such as `REM`, `LET`, `PRINT`, `INPUT`, `GOTO`, `IF`, `END`.
- Supports expression parsing and syntax tree display.
- Provides a debug mode that allows setting breakpoints and viewing variable values.
- Supports loading, editing, and running programs.

**Usage:**
- Load and edit BASIC programs through the input box or LOAD button.
- Execute the program using the RUN button.
- In debug mode, manage breakpoints using ADD and DELETE commands.

**Notes:**
- Ensure that the program statements are correctly formatted.
- Code editing is disabled in debug mode.

Enjoy using the QBasic project!
